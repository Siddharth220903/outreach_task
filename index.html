            <p> Cell has come up with another such opportunity for you all, which will help to make your college journey serene and more productive. We are launching the 4th edition of our flagship event for sophomore students, the Alumni Buddy Program, where you'll have a fantastic opportunity to interact with an alum personally. We understand that deciding whether to go for research, continuing with core, exploring finance, or trying for software roles is very confusing. And here, the alumni come to your rescue, with years of experience in their respective fields, clearing your doubts and guiding you in your career. </p><p>An Alumni Buddy is like a godmother/godfather assigned to you who you can connect with for advice on several topics and help you advance towards your dream career. </p>
           <p> Wait no longer and sign up now to get yourself a mentor before they all run out! </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            <p>Hello Y18 and Y19 students!</p>
        <p>With a fresh counselling season knocking on our doors, we have a new batch of students ready to take on one of the most experience-driven journeys of their lives. Yes! We're talking about the upcoming Y21 batch. IIT Kanpur has always believed in harmonious and fulfilling campus culture, and our Campus Junta is like our second family thus we always look out for each other, even before they become part of this extended family. In the same spirit, we bring to you the Open House Sessions. </p>
            <p> This event looks forward to make the upcoming batch familiar with the academic culture of IIT Kanpur, and their seniors will conduct 30-40 minute sessions in their respective coaching centers and guide prospective candidates on the teaching patterns, academic behavior, insights on what their preferred department has to offer, and the life at IIT Kanpur campus. Since it would be an interactive session, you would be addressing their relevant doubts which in the future could play a deciding part in determining their choices while filling the counselling preferences.</p>
           <p> Please keep in mind that when you're in the session you would be the voice and ears of IIT Kanpur, you can motivate students in ways that can not only define their college and career, but also the reputation of our institute. </p>
            <p>We hope to see your registrations in large numbers.
